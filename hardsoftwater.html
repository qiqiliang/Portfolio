    <h2> Hard Water vs Soft Water</h2>
    <p> Water that contains a high mineral content, specifically calcium and magnesium, is called hard water. 
    When soap is added to hard water, the water will have a difficult time forming bubbles. In other words, hard water does not lather 
    as well as soft water. The Epsom salt in the experiment will mimic the calcium and magnesium ions in hard water.</p>
