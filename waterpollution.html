    <h1>Water pollution: beaches, power plants, and groundwater </h1> 
    <p> Everyday, thousands of galllons of water drain into rivers, oceans, and streams. Raw sewage that pour 
    into our drinking sources not only cause irreversible damage to wildlife but also further expose us to diseases such as
    hepatitus, rashes, and stomach flu. Beaches and groundwater are major victims of these issues. For avid beach lovers, swimming in 
    waters contaminated with toxins can cause serious injuries to the body. Similarily, the increasing use of groundwater for agricultural, mining, and oil 
    and gas operations causes groundwater pollution that destroy ecosystems dependent on groundwater. Likewise, coal fueled power plants dump millions
    of tons of toxic chemicals in waterways, destroying billions of marine life and further contaminating our water sources. </p>
