    <p>You might ask yourself, where does all the water on Earth come from? Before much of the water taht existe on the Earth now, 
      there was magma. The magma contained water that was released into the atmosphere during volcanic activities. 
      The water is suspended in the atmosphere for a period of time and then falls back to Earth in a process called the water cycle.
      The four main parts of the water cycle include evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection. Evaporation occurs when the water 
      from rivers/streams/oceans/ground gets turned into vapor. For plants, this process is known as transpiration. When the water particles in the air
      cool, they condense back to the liquid state and form clouds. Once the droplets become too heavy for the cloud to hold, they fall back to the 
      ground as precipitate(snow, hail, rain). Finally, the water gets reabsorbed by the ground and the process repeats. The water cycle
      helps scientists better understand weather patterns and thus better prepare communities in turns of natural disasters.
