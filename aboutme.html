 <p style = "font-style: Eurostile" style = "text-align: center" style = "float: left" > GREETINGS TO ALL!! I'm very glad to meet you, as you can tell:) So, just a little bit about myself: 
     I am originally from Guangzhou, China, and I moved here(California) when I was about 5. I am from a family 
     that emphasized heavily on sports, expecially running. To be more specific, my entire family are composed of distance
     runners...except for me. I am a sprinter(200m and 400m :). I love reading as well, mostly non-fiction sciency books, haha yes
     I am a nerd. BUT, I do have a favorite fiction series that I started in 6th grade; Anyone heard of Keeper of the Lost Cities? YESSSSSSS I LOVE THAT SERIES!!! Go Team Keefe!!(I will post a link down below if anyone is interested. Its amazing.)  Anyway, moving on, my favorite food is...well...I like everything. No, seriously, everything(From eggplants to triple chocolate lava cakes!)
  And finally...let me apologize to all the dog-lovers out there...I prefer cats. Meow. </p>
