 <p style = "font-style: Eurostile" style = "text-align: center" style = "float: left"> GREETINGS TO ALL!! I'm very glad to meet you, as you can tell:) So, just a little bit about myself: 
     I am originally from Guangzhou, China, and <br>I moved here(California) when I was about 5. I am from a family 
     that emphasized heavily on sports, expecially running. To be more specific, my entire family <br>are composed of distance
     runners...except for me. I am a sprinter(200m and 400m :). I love reading as well, mostly non-fiction sciency books, haha yes
     I am a nerd. My favorite food is...well...I like everything. <br>No, seriously, everything(From eggplants to triple chocolate lava cakes!)
     And finally...let me apologize to all the dog-lovers out there...I prefer cats. Meow.
