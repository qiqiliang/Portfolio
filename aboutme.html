     If there was one noun, abjective, verb to describe me, it would probably be athlete, athletic, and run. Hahaha, yes
     by now, you'd proabably guess that I love the outdoors and sports.  I have competed in track state championships and 
     swimming championships numerous of times. (Shout out to all the butterfliers and 200m and 400m sprinter out there!! <3 <3) 
     My dream career is to use technology to aid athletes, specifically athletes who are physically disabled or mentally challanged.
     And finally, while I usually prefer non-fiction there is a fiction series I MUST SHARE! Anyone heard of Keeper of The Lost Cities?
     Yep, hands upto Keefe ALL THE WAY!! (Link to series below!) <b>
