    <h2> Mixing with water</h2>
    <p> Have you ever heard of like dissolves like? Well, this saying is just right for mixing with water! Water 
    is a polar substance, which means that on one end of the water molecule, it is slightly negative and on the other end
    of the molecule, it is slightly positive. Water can only dissolve other polar substances. Any non polar substance, such as oil will
    not be able to dissolve in water. </p>
