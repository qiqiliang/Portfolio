    <h1> Water Purification Techniques </h1>
    <ol>
      <li> Sediment filtration </li>
      <p> The idea of sediment filtration is separate large sediments from water. One method to do this is to place a cotton shirt
     over a clean bowl and pour the water over the shirt. The cotton shirt traps large sediments and filter them from the water. Aside from
      using a cotton shirt, you can also use a fine-mesh strainer, muslin, or dish towel. </p>
      <li> SODIS</li>
      </p> SODIS is a popular method used in water purification. This process utilizes heat to eliminate harmful bacteria while UVA rays 
          from the sun pasterizes the water.
          This method requires a colorless, transparent bottle. The water is placed into the bottle and left in the sun. A 
    rule of thumb is that if less than half of the sky is covered in clouds, the bottle should be placed in the sun for at least 6 hours. Otherwise
    the bottle should be left outside for at least 2 days. </p>
      <li> Ion exchange</li>
  <p> 
    The process of ion exchange is generally used for softening hard water and deionization. Ions such as calcium and magnesium may cause scaling
    in your home's water systems. This may cause the systems to fail. In ion exchange, ions such as sodium and chloride are exchanged for the
    hard ions, magnesium and calcium.    
  </p>
  <li>Other methods include boiling, carbon adsorbtion, and microporous basic filtration. </li>
